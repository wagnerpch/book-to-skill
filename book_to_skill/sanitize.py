# Invisible code points used to hide document-borne prompt injection. Grouped by
# attack shape so the reasoning behind each entry stays reviewable.

# 1. Zero-width and invisible spacers. Render as nothing, so text between them is
#    invisible to a human reading the page but plain to the model.
_ZERO_WIDTH_CODEPOINTS = frozenset({
    0x200B,  # ZERO WIDTH SPACE
    0x200C,  # ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER
    0x200D,  # ZERO WIDTH JOINER
    0x2060,  # WORD JOINER
    0xFEFF,  # ZERO WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE / BOM outside position 0
    0x00AD,  # SOFT HYPHEN — invisible except at a line break
    0x034F,  # COMBINING GRAPHEME JOINER — no rendering effect at all

# 2. Bidirectional formatting controls — the Trojan Source class
#    (CVE-2021-42574). These do not change the character sequence a model reads,
#    they change the order a human SEES. A crafted line can display as innocuous
#    study advice while the model consumes an injected instruction, so the
#    reviewer approving a generated skill and the agent loading it disagree.
#    Removing them makes rendered order match logical order.
#
#    Legitimate right-to-left books are unaffected: the Unicode Bidi Algorithm
#    derives direction from the characters themselves, so Arabic and Hebrew still
#    render right-to-left without these. Only explicit embeddings, overrides and
#    isolates are dropped, and running prose essentially never needs them.
_BIDI_CONTROL_CODEPOINTS = frozenset({
    0x200E,  # LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK

#    them) but still render as blank width. Unlike a space they are letters, so
#    they survive whitespace normalisation and can pad hidden text.

# 5. Deprecated / annotation format controls. All category Cf,
#    Default_Ignorable, and render as nothing — the same invisible
#    format-control shape as group 1, just blocks the original list missed.
#    None has any use in extracted book prose.

# 5. Variation selectors. The same smuggling trick as the tag block, moved to a
#    block that survives more pipelines: each selector carries one of 256
#    values, so a run of them after any base character encodes an arbitrary
#    payload while rendering as nothing at all. They are combining marks rather
#    than format controls, so a category-based filter that catches Cf misses
#    them entirely.
#
#    Dropping them costs only the emoji/text presentation hint on a character
#    that already renders, which is a smaller loss than U+200D above already
#    accepts by splitting emoji ZWJ sequences.

# 7. Interlinear annotation controls. A conforming renderer hides the annotation
#    between the anchor and the terminator, so text a human never sees is still
